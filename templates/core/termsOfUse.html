            <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
            <p>Thank you for visiting A.L.F.A Errortronics, the quirkiest online marketplace for electronics and accessories, proudly based in our grandma's basement. Before you embark on this delightful adventure, please take a moment to read our tongue-in-cheek Terms of Use:</p>

            <h2>1. Basement Adventure</h2>
            <p>We invite you to explore our basement-based emporium with a sense of wonder and humor. If you happen to stumble upon a lost sock, please treat it with respect. It might just have more processing power than you think.</p>

            <h2>2. Grandma's Wisdom</h2>
            <p>Our customer service is powered by Grandma's age-old wisdom and maybe a dash of homemade cookies. Be prepared for advice that's both tech-savvy and life-savvy.</p>

            <h2>3. Cat Interruptions</h2>
            <p>Our cat, Buttons, occasionally interrupts phone calls and chats. Feel free to engage in feline discourse or ask for a translation of their latest meow. It's all part of the experience.</p>

            <h2>4. Hidden Treasures</h2>
            <p>You may come across mysterious items that even our grandma doesn't remember buying. Embrace these surprises; they're like Easter eggs in a video game, minus the chocolate.</p>

            <h2>5. Privacy and Cookies</h2>
            <p>We take your privacy seriously, but sometimes our cookies mysteriously disappear. Rest assured, they're not tracking cookies, but rather chocolate chips. If you find one, consider yourself lucky!</p>

            <h2>6. Return Policy</h2>
            <p>If you're not satisfied with your purchase, simply return it within 30 days. However, you may receive a heartfelt letter from Grandma convincing you to keep it instead. Be prepared to reconsider your choices.</p>

            <h2>7. Legal Stuff</h2>
            <p>This Terms of Use agreement is more of a good-natured agreement than a legal one. We don't have a legal team, but we do have a great sense of humor. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out, and Grandma will respond personally, possibly with a story from her childhood.</p>

            <p>By using A.L.F.A Errortronics, you agree to these terms and enter into the basement of enchantment. Welcome aboard!</p>
